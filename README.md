## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learnt how to change my cursor and how to make use of the hover pseudo-selector.


```css
:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```


### Continued development
I'm still going to be working on interactiveness and use of pseudoselectors seeing as I had issues using them while working on this project.

### Useful resources

- [fullstackoverflow.com](https://www.fullstackoverflow.com) - This site helped me in my research. I saw answer to questions I had in mind concerning this project.
